# NMS-BetterRewards
A mod for No Man's Sky called Better Rewards

This is just a backup repository, you can find the full mod on nexusmods:
www.nexusmods.com/nomanssky/mods/1460

Every patch have 4 versions:
- BetterRewards: This is the main mod
- BetterFrigateRewards: This changes Frigther Mission rewards
- BetterFrigateRewards+BetterRewards: Merged mod with the above 2
- BetterRewardsNoWR: Everything that the main mod has to offer minus Words and Resources increase

If you want to use lua files included, you have to have AMUMSS to build a mod with them.

I created a little guide for AMUMSS and lua files: https://i.imgur.com/VRRkzXB.png

Better Rewards increases the amount of units, nanite clusters and quicksilver you get from completing missions or interacting with objects in the world.
Non npc word learning (such as knowledge stones, monoliths and dictionaries) is also faster.

**Currency**

Currency gain is roughly increased by 5 times, so as to make it a viable option besides crafting and selling valuable tradeables.
Some unit values were tremendously increased (eg.: from minimum amount of 1000-2000 to 20000-50000) like the terminals in abandoned settlements to make the early game less grindy.

Includes:
- Space station missions and Nexus missions
- Interactable objects/devices (abandoned buildings, damaged machinery, waypoints, etc.)
- Sentinels
- Alien interactions

**Words**

Learning words from non npc interactions (knowledge stones, monoliths, plaques and dictionaries) is also 3 times faster (3 words learned form a single knowledge stone).

**Resources**

When gathering with the mining beam you generally get 3 times more resources (but only when the things explode as you mine them).
Also includes containers, depots, guild rewards, asteroids and ships that drop resources.

**Installation**

Make sure you delete or edit DISABLEMODS.TXT in your game library (...\Steam\steamapps\common\No Man's Sky\GAMEDATA\PCBANKS) before trying to use mods.
Extract the zip file to (...\Steam\steamapps\common\No Man's Sky\GAMEDATA\PCBANKS\MODS) folder and you are good to go (Create MODS folder if you don't have one).

Alternatively you can just use Vortex to download and install.

This mod modifies the REWARDTABLE.MBIN and EXPEDITIONREWARDTABLE.MBIN file and will not work with other mods that use those tables.
